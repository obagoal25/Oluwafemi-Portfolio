<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../Assets/Images/My office pic.png" height="350" alt="my office outfit"/>

<p>My name is Oluwafemi O. I am in my thirties and currently reside in London, UK.<br />
I live in a town that is situated at the foothills of a mountain. I live alone. I studied<br />
Microbiology at Moshood Abiola Polytechnic. It is not a very large school, but it <br />
was what I could afford.</p>
<p>I am a hard-working and driven individual who isn't afraid to face a challenge. I'm<br />
passionate about my work and I know how to get the job done. I would describe <br />
myself as an open and honest person who doesn't believe in misleading other <br />
people and tries to be fair in everything I do.</p>
